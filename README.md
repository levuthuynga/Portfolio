# Portfolio - Le Vu Thuy Nga

## About me

Hi! I'm Le Vu Thuy Nga and welcome to my Portfolio! 

I graduated from Hanoi Foreign Trade University, International Business Economics major, where data science just appeared a bit in econometrics subject.  Data Analysis came to me through Google Data Analytic Course, that gave me inspiration to dive deeper into this field. The more I learn, the more I realize there are many amazing things that we can do with a set of data, which excites me to continue my journey to become a data analyst.

## Projects

This site holds all of my personal projects that are divided into 3 differents repositories:
1. [Excel Project](https://github.com/levuthuynga/Excel-Projects)
2. [SQL Project](https://github.com/levuthuynga/SQL-Projects)
3. [Tableau Project](https://github.com/levuthuynga/Tableau-Projects)

My projects usually go through 5 steps:
- Ask: define goals of the projects
- Prepare: find needed and reliable data
- Process: clean data
- Analyze: find useful insights from data
- Share: visualize and present

The first 4 steps are performed in Excel and SQL Projects, which should be accompanied by a documentation in README.md file. Last step is showed in Tableau Project.
