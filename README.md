### About me

Hi! I'm Le Vu Thuy Nga and welcome to my Portfolio. I graduated from Hanoi Foreign Trade University where I majored in International Business Economics.  

Data Analysis came to me through Google Data Analytic Course, which gave me inspiration to dive deeper into this field. The more I learn, the more I realize there are many things I don't know, which excites me to continue my journey to become a data analyst.
